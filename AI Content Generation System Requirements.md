# AI Content Generation System Requirements

## System Overview
The AI Content Generation System is a comprehensive platform that leverages free accounts and tokens from major AI providers to build tools and generate content. The system intelligently prioritizes tasks in a queue based on each AI provider's specific competencies.

## Supported AI Providers and Their Competencies

| AI Provider | Primary Competency | Use Cases |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| GPT (OpenAI) | Image generation | Creating visual content, illustrations, graphics |
| MANUS | Project code generation | Building complete software projects, complex coding tasks |
| Claude (Anthropic) | Alternative code generation | Secondary code generation, different coding approaches |
| Grok, Gemini, Perplexity | Prompt generation | Creating optimized prompts for other AI systems |
| Lindy.ai | Meeting tracking | Transcription, summarization, and tracking of meetings |
| Lumenor | Monthly people images | Generating consistent images of people on a monthly basis |

## Core Features

### Task Queue Management
- Task submission interface for users to request content generation
- Priority-based queue system that routes tasks to appropriate AI providers
- Task status tracking and notification system
- Ability to pause, resume, and cancel tasks

### AI Provider Integration
- Authentication and token management for multiple free AI accounts
- API integration with all supported AI providers
- Token usage tracking and optimization
- Fallback mechanisms when primary AI is unavailable

### Content Generation
- Support for multiple content types (text, code, images)
- Content quality assessment
- Content revision and improvement workflows
- Content organization and categorization

### User Management
- User registration and authentication
- User role management (admin, content creator, viewer)
- User preferences and settings

## Task Prioritization Logic
1. Analyze incoming task requirements
2. Match task type to optimal AI provider based on competency matrix
3. Check token availability for selected provider
4. If tokens are limited, evaluate task priority against other queued tasks
5. Route task to secondary provider if primary is unavailable
6. Monitor task execution and adjust routing as needed

## User Flows

### Content Creator Flow
1. Log in to the system
2. Create new content generation task
3. Specify content requirements and parameters
4. Submit task to queue
5. Receive notifications on task progress
6. Review and approve/revise generated content
7. Download or export final content

### Administrator Flow
1. Log in with admin credentials
2. Monitor overall system performance
3. Manage AI provider connections and tokens
4. View analytics on usage patterns
5. Adjust prioritization rules as needed
6. Manage user accounts and permissions
